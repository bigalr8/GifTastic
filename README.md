AJAX requests and JSON data format

App allows user to retrieve images from a large set of related subjects using buttons provided for them. 
In this case, automobile makes. 
The images can be switched between still and animated versions. 
The user can also add additional subjects for image retrieval. 

This assignment was very interesting in that it combined AJAX with JSON for API interfacing and jQuery button 
and image generation.

I did encounter issues with event handlers not being generated or being lost for buttons and images. This was resolved 
through the use of event delegation.

Any modeling for the code was based on class room activity code examples.
